## BOQ Calculation Rules (Must Follow)
- Full rules: docs/ARAHAN_PENGIRAAN.md
- Price references (mandatory):
  - data/Materials.txt
  - data/Labour.txt
- Output must be Markdown tables (inline in chat), not HTML.
- For area-based scopes: must show both RM/sqft and RM/sqm.
- If an item is missing from Materials/Labour: stop and ask before calculating.
