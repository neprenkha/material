## BOQ Calculation Rules (Must Follow)
- Full rules: docs/1.1ARAHAN.md
- Price references (mandatory):
  - data/1.2 Materials
  - data/1.3 Labour
- Output must be Markdown tables (inline in chat), not HTML.
- For area-based scopes: must show both RM/sqft and RM/sqm.
- If an item is missing from Materials/Labour: stop and ask before calculating.
